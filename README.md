# Machine Learning Projects

## Kaggle

Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle allows users to collaborate with other users, find and publish datasets, use GPU integrated notebooks, and compete with other data scientists to solve data science challenges.

The notebooks and the problem statements I solved on kaggle are noted below:

| Dataset | Notebook |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Potato Disease Leaf Dataset(PLD)][a] | [/code/paritprathamesh/potato-disease][1] |
| [Email Spam Classification][b] | [/code/paritprathamesh/spam-or-not-spam-pp/][2] |
| [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster][c] | [/code/paritprathamesh/][3] |
| [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques][d] | [/code/paritprathamesh/][4] |
| [Digit Recognizer][e] | [/code/paritprathamesh/][5] |
| [Facial Keypoints Detection][f] | [/code/paritprathamesh/][6] |
| [Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn][g] | [/code/paritprathamesh/][7] |
